asterisk-ami (Example application)
==================================

At the top level of this repository (i.e. here) you find an example application using the asterisk-ami library.
The actual library is found in the `asterisk-ami` folder.

`asterisk-ami` is a small crate that establishes a TCP/IP connecto to the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and
exchanges actions, responses, and events over this connection.
